# Welcome to Surviv++ (formerly known as Surviv+) ! ðŸ˜ƒ

This is a Surviv.io cheat loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by [reuke](https://github.com/reuke), but since he has been away, I've decided to take ownership of the development of the code. 

Since the retirement of the repos by [w3x](https://github.com/w3x731) and [PowerOfUniverse](https://github.com/PowerOfUniverse) (aka Najlepszy56), it's been decided that's in the best interest to merge our extensions into one. I give huge credit to PowerOfUniverse for the incredible amount of contributions he has made, and hope that one day I will pass the torch for someone else to carry.

Unfortunately, this also means a couple of the recent features on the other extension was rolled back including the notification style and the Triggerbot. Hopefully we will eventually have them back!

## ðŸ¤” FAQ
> **What do I do if the cheat stops working?**

This usually means the game's code was patched (meaning they updated it where variables and functionality has changed). If this happens, the most you can do is create an issue. Give it some time and the cheat will work again. 
> **This feature isn't working for me! WTF?**


Relax. Open the console (Hit F12), and copy what the error is, and just [create an issue](https://github.com/Kalaborative/survivio-cheat/issues). Additionally, the extension has been setup to automatically report any errors to my server!


> **Does this hack give you infinite health?**

No.

> **What about slowdown of bullets?**

Nope.

> **Okay, what about auto trigger?**

It's being looked into. Could be a possibility.

> **What is "bump fire"?**

This is a feature for specific non-automatic guns (guns that you cannot hold down the left-click to shoot). By holding down left-click for these guns, they fire at the fastest rate acting like an automatic. (Think of it like an autoclicker.)

> **Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?**

This was on the store before, but it got taken down (not sure why). I could try uploading it myself, but this will be the safest route for now.

> **Are pull requests allowed?**

Your contributions are always welcome. If you see something that should be improved or a feature added, feel free to fork this repo and create a PR.
