# Getting Started

This is a Surviv.io cheat loaded as a Chrome extension. It was originally developed by reuke, but since he has been away, I've decided to take ownership of the development of the code.

#### Features

* Displays enemy lines
* Aimbot with customizable prediction and speed settings
* Custom zooming control with scroll wheel
* FPS Counter
* Autoloot
* Transparent buildings, ceilings, obstacles, and trees
* Lasersight (shot range)
* Frag grenade timer
* Custom key bindings

## Does this work?
Yes, it currently works. 

## Installation

Download this repo as a ZIP file. Extract the ZIP file you just downloaded. 
Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser. Make sure you have Developer Mode activated.
Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder that you extracted (called `survivio-cheat-master`)
Open surviv.io.
