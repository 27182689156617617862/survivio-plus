	<p>If you can read this cheat was loaded up. Probably, it will even work now.</p>
	<p>If it won't try to press Ctrl-F5 and F5</p>
	<p>In game you can now open <span class="highlight" style="display: inline;">Esc</span>-menu and find out new buttons. That's cheat functions. Everything is toggled on by default.</p>
	<p>If something not working, make sure you are using Chrome. If game was just updated and cheat not working it means i need to update <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/survivio-cheat/dhjbajnikgblcpeolmhckmejcnjojpod" target="_blank">this extension</a>. If it's not updated it means i don't care already or just too busy or didn't notice. You can try to <a href="https://discord.gg/g57ZpBJ" target="_blank">text me in Discord</a>, but i'm not sure how this can help.</p>
