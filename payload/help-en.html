	<h3>Here is the cheats</h3>
	<small>Apr. 15, 2018</small>
	<p><strong>Привет</strong></p>
	<p>If you can read this cheat was loaded up. Probably, it will even work now.</p>
	<p>In game you can now open <span class="highlight_help">Esc</span>-menu and find out new buttons. That's cheat functions. Everything is toggled on by default.</p>
	<p>If something not working, make sure you are using Chrome. If game was just updated and cheat not working it means i need to update <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/survivio-cheat/dhjbajnikgblcpeolmhckmejcnjojpod" target="_blank">this extension</a>. If it's not updated it means i don't care already or just too busy or didn't notice. You can try to <a href="https://discord.gg/g57ZpBJ" target="_blank">text me in Discord</a>, but i'm not sure how this can help.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight_help">Right mouse button</span> - autoaim. Keep in mind that autoaim restriction is turned on by default and it means that you still need to aim roughly or turn restrictions off.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight_help">C</span> - team pings. <span class="highlight_help">B</span> - emotes. Because right mouse is used for autoaim.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight_help">Mouse wheel</span> - zoom. Use <span class="highlight_help">1</span>, <span class="highlight_help">2</span>, <span class="highlight_help">3</span>, <span class="highlight_help">4</span> to switch weapons.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight_help">Shift</span> - display enemy names.</p>
	<h3>News</h3>
	<small>May 21, 2018</small>
	<p>Futher autoaim improvement. For now your ping is taken into account in the calculations. Should help high (>100) ping players.  There is option to disable it in menu and if it made it worse for you, you always can turn it off.</p>
	<p>FPS and latency counter position in duo/squads fixed.</p>
	<p>Loading stability increased. But now you can't start playing till everything will be fully loaded.</p>
	<p>Predictions display options removed. Anyway it was mostly for debug.</p>
	<small>May 16, 2018</small>
	<p>Changed Discord server to stop disturbing common fair-play people from the previous one.</p>
	<p>FPS and latency counter added.</p>
	<p>Pressing Shift will let you see their names before you shoot them.</p>
	<small>May 04, 2018</small>
